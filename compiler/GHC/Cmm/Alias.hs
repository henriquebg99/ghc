{- Note [Heap Kinds]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Our goal is to allow sinking into assignments to Hp.
That is for a sequence like:

  c1 = [R1 + 8]
  c2 = [R1 + 16]
  [Hp-16] = c1
  [Hp-8] = c2

We want to inline the assignments to get:

  [Hp-16] = [R1 + 8]
  [Hp-8] = [R1 + 16]

To achieve this we split heap memory references into three kinds.
OldHeap, NewHeap, AnyHeap.

* Reading from heap memory is defined to be OldHeap.
* Writing to HpReg is defined to be a reference to NewHeap.
* Reading from Hp for assignmentsis defined to be AnyHeap


New/OldHeap don't conflict. All other references do conflict.

Examples

  c1 = [R1 + 8]
  [Hp-16] = c1
  => Can be sunk as Old/New don't conflict.

  [Hp-16] = c1
  d = [Hp-24]
  [Hp-24] = c2
  e = d
  => The assignment to d conflicts with the write to [Hp-24].
     `[Hp-24]` is AnyHeap which will conflict with a write to NewHeap.

-- Dangerous, but works out fine.
  x = [Hp-16]
  y = x
  [Hp-16] = 0
  z = x
=> We would drop the assignment to x before the write to [Hp-16]

This is of course a hack. Because we will sink into an assignment
to [Hp-8], but not into one for x = Hp; [x-8].
Even though they are the same.

It also depends on Hp never being used to write to "old" heap. This
isn't something our code generation ever does, so that seems fine.

It makes easy to break this optimization in Hand-written Cmm though.
Not sure it matters. Code that uses HP to alias non-newly allocated
heap seems pretty out there.

-----------------------

Informally we can look at why this is safe. If we trip on aliasing it
means we sink a read *past* an aliased write.

That is we start semantically with a variant of: x = [mem1]; [mem2] = y but rewrite
it later to [mem2] = y; x = [mem1]. Where mem1 and mem2 are aliased.

What prevents this is the `conflicts` check on stores.
In broad strokes we are checking for `memConflicts (memExpr [mem1]) (storeAddr [mem2]).

We haven't changed the behaviour for heap vs non-heap memory. So the only way we introduce
failure is if *both* expressions are determined to be some kind of heap memory.

We have these combinations:

Store | Load -> Resolution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Any | _    -> Conflicts
  _   | Any  -> Conflicts
  New | New  -> Conflicts
  Old | Old  -> Conflicts
  New | Old  -> No conflict
  Old | New  -> Impossible

Old|New is impossible since loads only get assigned HeapAny or HeapOld.
This leaves the combination of New|Old.

New implies the store is of the kind `[Hp+offset] = <e>`. (See `storeAddr`).
While Old implies the RHS of the assignment we went to sink past the store:
* Does not mention Hp (or we would get Any instead of Old)
* Mentions some Gc pointer.

So we can narrow down our failure modes to a pattern of the kind:

foo = [gcPtr<op>e]
[Hp+off] = <e>

The failure case then becomes that gcPtr<op>e and [Hp+off] alias. Can this arise?

bar = Hp + off
foo = [bar]
[Hp+off] = <e>

If bar isn't sunk into foo then we indeed we can end up with:

1 bar = Hp + off
3 [Hp+off] = <e>
2 foo = [bar]

This is because foo looks like a regular GcPtr to CmmSink. God damnit.
We could avoid this by making "references Hp" a transitive property.

Not sure how to best do this though.

-- Having SpMem is important because it lets us float loads from Sp
-- past stores to Sp as long as they don't overlap, and this helps to
-- unravel some long sequences of
--    x1 = [Sp + 8]
--    x2 = [Sp + 16]
--    ...
--    [Sp + 8]  = xi
--    [Sp + 16] = xj
--
-- Note that SpMem is invalidated if Sp is changed, but the definition
-- of 'conflicts' above handles that.

-- ToDo: this won't currently fix the following commonly occurring code:
--    x1 = [R1 + 8]
--    x2 = [R1 + 16]
--    ..
--    [Hp - 8] = x1
--    [Hp - 16] = x2
--    ..

-- because [R1 + 8] and [Hp - 8] are both HeapMem.  We know that
-- assignments to [Hp + n] do not conflict with any other heap memory,
-- but this is tricky to nail down.  What if we had
--
--   x = Hp + n
--   [x] = ...
--
--  the store to [x] should be "new heap", not "old heap".
--  Furthermore, you could imagine that if we started inlining
--  functions in Cmm then there might well be reads of heap memory
--  that was written in the same basic block.  To take advantage of
--  non-aliasing of heap memory we will have to be more clever.

-- Note [Foreign calls clobber heap]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
--
-- It is tempting to say that foreign calls clobber only
-- non-heap/stack memory, but unfortunately we break this invariant in
-- the RTS.  For example, in stg_catch_retry_frame we call
-- stmCommitNestedTransaction() which modifies the contents of the
-- TRec it is passed (this actually caused incorrect code to be
-- generated).
--
-- Since the invariant is true for the majority of foreign calls,
-- perhaps we ought to have a special annotation for calls that can
-- modify heap/stack memory.  For now we just use the conservative
-- definition here.
--
-- Some CallishMachOp imply a memory barrier e.g. AtomicRMW and
-- therefore we should never float any memory operations across one of
-- these calls.
--
-- `suspendThread` releases the capability used by the thread, hence we mustn't
-- float accesses to heap, stack or virtual global registers stored in the
-- capability (e.g. with unregisterised build, see #19237).
